# TODOs

I want to use this to participate in the [AIMO](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/ai-mathematical-olympiad-progress-prize-3)

- Choose a small reasoning model to experiment with
- Gather all the Math datasets
- Generate train/test dataset by keepinng 80/20 percent of problems from all datasets
- Check no problems are leaked in the test set
- Use LLM to generate dataset for itself based on the failed examples
- Run for few iterations and see if the model performance improves
- If it does experiment with a bigger model.
